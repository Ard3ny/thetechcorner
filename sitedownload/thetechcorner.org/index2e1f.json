For most people, they seem redundant, as they serve the same purpose and would&nbsp;often show the same thing. The main difference between Man and Info is the amount of content that they have; Info contains a whole lot more than Man does. Some people like Info because they can get a lot more from it, while others like Man because it is straight to the point, and they can quickly get what they want without wasting time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Man is actually older than Info, and it is slowly being replaced. But because Man is older, it is highly likely that it has the documentation that you are looking for. If you try to get the documentation with Info, and it finds nothing, you would get the Man page instead. This is what has led many people to believe that the two are one and the same, as they would get the same page with either one.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Documentation in \/usr\/share\/doc<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The \/usr\/share\/doc directory stores documentation(release notes, installation guide etc.) for all packages under respective directories by the name of package.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can read this documentation simply by opening the text file within the folder of desired package, for example let&#8217;s say we want to know more about &#8220;grep&#8221;. Simply list out the content of the grep folder and pick a text file you want to read.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"is-layout-flow wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">ls \/usr\/share\/doc\/grep\/<\/pre>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-default\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"326\" height=\"39\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/thetechcorner.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/image-71.png?resize=326%2C39&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-740\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/thetechcorner.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/image-71.png?w=326&amp;ssl=1 326w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/thetechcorner.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/image-71.png?resize=300%2C36&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/thetechcorner.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/image-71.png?resize=24%2C3&amp;ssl=1 24w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/thetechcorner.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/image-71.png?resize=36%2C4&amp;ssl=1 36w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/thetechcorner.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/image-71.png?resize=48%2C6&amp;ssl=1 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 326px) 100vw, 326px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"is-layout-flow wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">less \/usr\/share\/doc\/grep\/less<\/pre>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-default\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"437\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/thetechcorner.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/image-72.png?resize=640%2C437&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-741\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/thetechcorner.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/image-72.png?w=724&amp;ssl=1 724w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/thetechcorner.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/image-72.png?resize=300%2C205&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/thetechcorner.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/image-72.png?resize=24%2C16&amp;ssl=1 24w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/thetechcorner.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/image-72.png?resize=36%2C25&amp;ssl=1 36w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/thetechcorner.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/image-72.png?resize=48%2C33&amp;ssl=1 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I&#8217;ve mentioned using man command in previous posts, but let&#8217;s dig a little deeper in [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":751,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"nf_dc_page":"","om_disable_all_campaigns":false,"_mi_skip_tracking":false},"categories":[219],"tags":[279,275,281,277,278,280,276,220],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/thetechcorner.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/rhsa-understand-and-use-essential-tools-2.png?fit=1280%2C720&ssl=1","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/thetechcorner.org\/index.php?rest_route=\/wp\/v2\/posts\/738"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/thetechcorner.org\/index.php?rest_route=\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/thetechcorner.org\/index.php?rest_route=\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/thetechcorner.org\/index.php?rest_route=\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/thetechcorner.org\/index.php?rest_route=%2Fwp%2Fv2%2Fcomments&post=738"}],"version-history":[{"count":2,"href":"https:\/\/thetechcorner.org\/index.php?rest_route=\/wp\/v2\/posts\/738\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":750,"href":"https:\/\/thetechcorner.org\/index.php?rest_route=\/wp\/v2\/posts\/738\/revisions\/750"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/thetechcorner.org\/index.php?rest_route=\/wp\/v2\/media\/751"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/thetechcorner.org\/index.php?rest_route=%2Fwp%2Fv2%2Fmedia&parent=738"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/thetechcorner.org\/index.php?rest_route=%2Fwp%2Fv2%2Fcategories&post=738"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/thetechcorner.org\/index.php?rest_route=%2Fwp%2Fv2%2Ftags&post=738"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
