But among the options you can use with <strong>cp<\/strong> are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>-i<\/strong> &#8212; interactive. Prompts you to confirm if the file is going to overwrite a file in your destination. This is a handy option because it can help prevent you from making mistakes.<\/li><li><strong>-r<\/strong> &#8212; recursive. Rather than just copying all the files and directories, copies the whole directory tree, subdirectories and all, to another location.<\/li><li><strong>-f<\/strong> &#8212; force. Copies without prompting you for confirmation that the file should be overwritten. Unless you&#8217;re sure you want to force the copy, you probably don&#8217;t want to make friends with this option right now.<\/li><li><strong>-v<\/strong> &#8211; verbose. Will show the progress of the files being copied.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Moving Files<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To move files, use the <strong>mv<\/strong> command, which is similar to the <strong>cp<\/strong> command, except that with <strong>mv<\/strong> the file is physically moved from one place to another, instead of being duplicated, as with <strong>cp<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Common options available with <strong>mv<\/strong> include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>-i<\/strong> &#8212; interactive. Will prompt you if the file you&#8217;ve selected will overwrite an existing file in the destination directory. This is a good option, because like the <strong>-i<\/strong> option in <strong>cp<\/strong>, you&#8217;ll be given the chance to make sure you want to replace an existing file.<\/li><li><strong>-f<\/strong> &#8212; force. Overrides the interactive mode and moves without prompting. Unless you know what you&#8217;re doing, this option doesn&#8217;t play nice; be very careful about using it until you become more comfortable with your system.<\/li><li><strong>-v<\/strong> &#8212; verbose. Shows a list of the files being moved.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to move a file out of your home directory and into another directory, you would type:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"is-layout-flow wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\"><strong><strong>mv pizza.txt furnace<\/strong><\/strong><\/pre>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Deleting Files and Directories<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Deleting files and directories with the <strong>rm<\/strong> command  is a straightforward process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s take our new file pizza.txt, and delete it from the furnace directory with the <strong>rm<\/strong> command:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"is-layout-flow wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\"><strong>rm pizza.txt<\/strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/pre>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Without specifying any other flags, rm command prompts you to if you are sure about deleting a file. Again, that&#8217;s where the <strong>-i<\/strong> (interactive) option comes in handy, because it gives a second chance to think about whether we really want to toss the file.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"is-layout-flow wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\"><strong>rm -i pizza.txt<\/strong> rm: remove 'pizza.txt'? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/pre>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also delete files using the regex <strong>*<\/strong>, but be careful, because you can easily delete files you didn&#8217;t intend to throw away.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To remove a file using a regex, you would type:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"is-layout-flow wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\"><strong>rm piz*<\/strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/pre>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also remove more than one file in one command, as in:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"is-layout-flow wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\"><strong>rm pizza.txt burger.txt<\/strong><\/pre>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Options for removing files &#8212; and directories &#8212; include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>-i<\/strong> &#8212; interactive. Prompts you to confirm the deletion. This is good.<\/li><li><strong>-f<\/strong> &#8212; force. Overrides interactive mode and removes the file(s) without prompting. This might not be good, unless you know exactly what you&#8217;re doing.<\/li><li><strong>-v<\/strong> &#8212; verbose. Shows a listing of files as they&#8217;re being removed.<\/li><li><strong>-r<\/strong> &#8212; recursive. When removing directories, will remove all of the files and the subdirectories of the specified directory. This can also get rid of an empty directory.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>To remove directories with <strong>rm<\/strong>, you must specify the <strong>-r<\/strong> option.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if you want to recursively remove the directory <strong>furnace <\/strong>you would type:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"is-layout-flow wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\"><strong>rm -r furnace<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/pre>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"is-layout-flow wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<p>And if you want to combine options:<\/p>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"is-layout-flow wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\"><strong>rm -rf furnace<\/strong><\/pre>\n<\/div><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Copying Files The copy command is not much more complex than typing: cp &lt;source&gt; &lt;destination&gt; [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":751,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"nf_dc_page":"","om_disable_all_campaigns":false,"_mi_skip_tracking":false},"categories":[219],"tags":[268,265,263,264,267,266,220],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/thetechcorner.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/rhsa-understand-and-use-essential-tools-2.png?fit=1280%2C720&ssl=1","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/thetechcorner.org\/index.php?rest_route=\/wp\/v2\/posts\/718"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/thetechcorner.org\/index.php?rest_route=\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/thetechcorner.org\/index.php?rest_route=\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/thetechcorner.org\/index.php?rest_route=\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/thetechcorner.org\/index.php?rest_route=%2Fwp%2Fv2%2Fcomments&post=718"}],"version-history":[{"count":4,"href":"https:\/\/thetechcorner.org\/index.php?rest_route=\/wp\/v2\/posts\/718\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":727,"href":"https:\/\/thetechcorner.org\/index.php?rest_route=\/wp\/v2\/posts\/718\/revisions\/727"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/thetechcorner.org\/index.php?rest_route=\/wp\/v2\/media\/751"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/thetechcorner.org\/index.php?rest_route=%2Fwp%2Fv2%2Fmedia&parent=718"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/thetechcorner.org\/index.php?rest_route=%2Fwp%2Fv2%2Fcategories&post=718"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/thetechcorner.org\/index.php?rest_route=%2Fwp%2Fv2%2Ftags&post=718"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
