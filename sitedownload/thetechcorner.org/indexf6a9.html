										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>If you are reading this then you prabaly know what a <strong>Raspberry PI</strong> is, but if you don&#8217;t it&#8217;s ok I&#8217;ll try to explain it to you as simple as possible and guide you threw the whole setup process.</p>



<p><strong>First, we need to clarify what Raspberi PI is:</strong></p>



<p>The&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/help/what-%20is-a-raspberry-pi/">Raspberry Pi</a></em>&nbsp;is a low cost, credit-card sized computer that plugs into a computer monitor or TV, and uses a standard keyboard and mouse. It is a capable little device that enables people of all ages to explore computing, and to learn how to program in languages like Scratch and Python. It’s capable of doing everything you’d expect a desktop computer to do, from browsing the internet and playing high-definition video, to making spreadsheets, word-processing, and playing games.</p>



<p></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img decoding="async" width="583" height="340" src="https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ezgif-1-110d2299363a.png?resize=583%2C340&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-138" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ezgif-1-110d2299363a.png?w=583&amp;ssl=1 583w, https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ezgif-1-110d2299363a.png?resize=300%2C175&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 583px) 100vw, 583px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p></p>



<p>So bassically, the Raspberry Pi is just a small computer that you can program to do pretty much anything with the right sensors and code.</p>



<p>The instructions that you will find here will guide you threw whole process of installation and will concist of the following:</p>



<ol><li><strong>All the necessary equipment you will need</strong></li><li><strong>How to download and write the operating system onto SD card</strong></li><li><strong>Installation process with a monitor</strong></li><li><strong>Installation process without a monitor</strong></li></ol>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<h3><strong>All the necessary equipment you will need</strong></h3>



<ol><li><strong>Raspberry PI</strong> (for this guide I will be using Raspberry PI 4 B, but you can use any model)</li><li><strong>Power supply for model you are using</strong> (you will need stronger power supply with newer model)</li><li><strong>SD Card </strong>or<strong> USB Flash Drive</strong></li><li><strong>Network </strong>or<strong> HDMI cable</strong> depending if you want to use monitor or not (for model 4B you will need micro HDMI)</li><li><strong>PC </strong>or<strong> laptop </strong>for downloading the OS and writing the image one SD card / USB</li></ol>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<h3><strong>How to download and write the operating system onto SD card</strong></h3>



<ol><li>First you will need to download some sort of operating system.  There are probabaly at minimum around 20 OS&#8217;s you can run on Raspberry PI.  You can even run the Windows ARM version on your PI. But then your full small programmable computer that can do pretty much anything kinda loses it&#8217;s purpose, right? Therefore, for this example we will run Raspbian, because it&#8217;s the easiest one to run and is probably the most compatible one as it was made exactly for this reason. But you can check out all the other possible OS&#8217;s <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/operating-systems/">here</a>. </li></ol>



<p>You can download three versions of Rasbian. Lite version, OS with desktop GUI version and OS with desktop GUI and all the other recommended software version. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="640" height="389" src="https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-1.png?resize=640%2C389&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-141" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-1.png?w=1608&amp;ssl=1 1608w, https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-1.png?resize=300%2C182&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-1.png?resize=1024%2C622&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-1.png?resize=768%2C467&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-1.png?resize=1536%2C933&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-1.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<p>We will continue with the <strong>Raspberry PI OS with desktop and recommended software</strong> because is the one that requries the least knowledge if you are not familiar with using a terminal or Linux. You can download the newest version <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/operating-systems/">here</a>.</p>



<p>2. Our next step will be downloading the software that will help us with writing the image. My favourite one is <a href="https://rufus.ie/">Rufus</a> so I&#8217;ll be using that. You will need to insert your SD card or USB into your PC and open up Rufus. Then, you will select the <strong>Device</strong> on which you want to write the image and <strong>SELECT</strong> the image that you want to write and then you press <strong>START</strong>.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="466" height="533" src="https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-2.png?resize=466%2C533&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-142" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-2.png?w=466&amp;ssl=1 466w, https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-2.png?resize=262%2C300&amp;ssl=1 262w" sizes="(max-width: 466px) 100vw, 466px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<h3><strong>Installation process with a monitor</strong></h3>



<p>After the proccess of writing the image is complete you will need to <strong>insert</strong> the <strong>SD card/USB into your Raspberry PI </strong>and <strong>connect</strong> your <strong>HDMI</strong> and <strong>power supply</strong> as well as your peripherals (<strong>keyboard and mouse</strong>). After a few seconds you should be greeted with a booting screen and a configuration process of your new OS in which you will select your country, timezone, language and the password of your wifi network. Now, If you connect your PI to WIFI, the system will ask you if you wish to automaticaly update your software packages to the newest version (If you don&#8217;t want to connect to WIFI now, or you want to use the ethernet cable, I will show you how to do so later on in this guide).</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<h3><strong>Installation process without a monitor</strong></h3>



<p>If you are like me and you had no idea that <strong>Raspberry PI 4 B</strong> comes with a <strong>mini HDMI port</strong> and not a normal sized version, this guide is for you! </p>



<p>The proccess is similar to an installation with a monitor, but first we need to add one more file into the booting section so Raspberry PI will know we want to connect to it over <strong>SSH</strong>. Now we need to create an empty file named &#8220;SSH&#8221;. The tricky part is that windows isn&#8217;t exactly the best thing for doing this easily. First, we need to <strong>right click&gt;new text document</strong> and call it <strong>SSH</strong>. However, we just made a text file and we need an empty file right? To do this, we need to <strong>open</strong> our <strong>SSH.txt</strong> file and in the left upper corner click <strong>File&gt;Save as</strong> and we will rename it to <strong>&#8220;SSH&#8221;</strong> with the quotation marks and select our Save as type as All Files. Then just press save and we should have an empty file called SSH.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="640" height="465" src="https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-4.png?resize=640%2C465&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-146" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-4.png?w=1043&amp;ssl=1 1043w, https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-4.png?resize=300%2C218&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-4.png?resize=1024%2C743&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-4.png?resize=768%2C557&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p></p>



<p>After this you can insert the SD card/USB into a PI, connect all your peripherals (keyboard and mouse) and a network cable. The other side of the network cable connects to your PC. </p>



<p>We will need some sort of SSH client. One of the most popular and user friendly ones is the <strong>PuTTY</strong>. You can download it <a href="https://www.putty.org/">here</a>. After you have downloaded and installed PuTTY,  type <strong>raspberrypi.local</strong> into a hostname and select port <strong>22</strong>. After that just select <strong>Open</strong>.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="450" height="434" src="https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-6.png?resize=450%2C434&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-149" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-6.png?w=450&amp;ssl=1 450w, https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-6.png?resize=300%2C289&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p></p>



<p>After that you will be prompted with the console asking for your login information. The default login and password information are</p>



<p><strong>Login: </strong>pi</p>



<p><strong>Password:</strong> raspberry</p>



<p></p>



<p>After this we need to enable the VNC interface which allows us to send display output over the network interface. We can do this by typing</p>



<div class="is-layout-flow wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted"> pi@raspberrypi:~ $&nbsp;<strong>sudo raspi-config</strong></pre>



<p></p>
</div></div>



<p>You will see this menu in which you will select <strong>Interface Option</strong> and then <strong>P3 VNC</strong>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="640" height="206" src="https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-8.png?resize=640%2C206&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-152" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-8.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-8.png?resize=300%2C96&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-8.png?resize=1024%2C329&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-8.png?resize=768%2C247&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Then go back into the menu again and select <strong>System Options</strong> and <strong>S5 Boot / Auto login</strong> and then <strong>B3 Desktop</strong>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="640" height="210" src="https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-11.png?resize=640%2C210&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-155" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-11.png?w=1257&amp;ssl=1 1257w, https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-11.png?resize=300%2C99&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-11.png?resize=1024%2C336&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-11.png?resize=768%2C252&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<p>And now just leave the menu with ESC and for a reboot type </p>



<div class="is-layout-flow wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted"><strong>sudo shutdown -r +0</strong></pre>
</div></div>



<p> After a few minutes your PI should be up again and we can continue.</p>



<p>We will need to download the <a href="https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/vnc/">VNC</a> that serves as a virtual bridge to our PI display interface. Install and open the VNC and on the top side of the software type the hostname of our device which we previosly entered into the PuTTY is <strong>raspberrypi.local</strong>. Enter our username which is <strong>PI</strong> and password <strong>raspberry</strong> and press ok.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="640" height="454" src="https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-12.png?resize=640%2C454&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-157" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-12.png?w=876&amp;ssl=1 876w, https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-12.png?resize=300%2C213&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-12.png?resize=768%2C545&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<p>With that your setup of the Raspberry PI is completed and you can fully enjoy it as you would be able to with the connected display.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<h3>Final configuration of the Raspbian OS</h3>



<p>After booting into your OS with or without a monitor you will need to make some finnal configurations of the system, such as updating your OS, changing your username, password, resolution etc. I will make another guide for this soon, but for now, have a nice day and enjoy your piece of PI. </p>
