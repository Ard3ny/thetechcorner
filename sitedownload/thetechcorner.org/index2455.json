This exam didn&#8217;t change significantly enough from 7 for me to talk about their differences. The one that changed heavily is RHCE in which is now Ansible and automatization the main topic. I&#8217;m planning on this certification as well but let&#8217;s not get ahead of ourselves.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Why did I decide to take certification?<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I feel like there is always need to learn new things. <strong>Certifications are a great way to do this, because it pushes you out of your comfort zone to study topics that exams requires. <\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>RHCE maybe seems like a basic certification for someone, but I think It&#8217;s a good way to start if you have some experience with Linux already. If you don&#8217;t, you should really start with an easier one. Here is the list of Red Hat exams in the tree diagram from which you can easily pick one, that suits your skill and knowledge level.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"559\" height=\"421\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/thetechcorner.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/image.png?resize=559%2C421&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-608\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/thetechcorner.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/image.png?w=559&amp;ssl=1 559w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/thetechcorner.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/image.png?resize=300%2C226&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/thetechcorner.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/image.png?resize=24%2C18&amp;ssl=1 24w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/thetechcorner.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/image.png?resize=36%2C27&amp;ssl=1 36w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/thetechcorner.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/image.png?resize=48%2C36&amp;ssl=1 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 559px) 100vw, 559px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Why did I choose RHSA and not someting else?<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many Linux or administration certification out there. I&#8217;ve done some research and decided to pick RHSA for a few reasons:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Red Hat is very respected company in Linux world and their OS system RH is one of the most used OSs<\/strong> (mostly larger corporation because of cost)<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>I<strong>t&#8217;s a practice exam<\/strong>. This means\u00a0it&#8217;s <strong>REAL WORLD<\/strong>\u00a0situation scenarios and not just some pick an\u00a0ABCD\u00a0answer to this question like\u00a0LPIC. In the way I see it <strong>EVERYBODY<\/strong> uses man pages, and stack overflow or just google when they\u00a0new\u00a0an answer. But the true\u00a0administration\u00a0skill is to apply this new knowledge on your problem, exam shouldn&#8217;t just test your memory, but it should test your\u00a0ability\u00a0to overcome problems.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Red Hat has many more exams you can do after RHSA<\/strong>, and It kinda lay a ground for a harder certification from them in which you need RHSA first <\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>It simply makes your resume looks nicer<\/strong>. This\u00a0may seem\u00a0like a stupid point, but what&#8217;s the even meaning of all studying if you won&#8217;t get rewarded in some way after. Sure you&#8217;ll get rewarded in a knowledge, but if it&#8217;s only about\u00a0knowledge\u00a0to\u00a0begin\u00a0with you may just watch some\u00a0YouTube\u00a0video guide, and you are good to go.\u00a0RHCSA\u00a0is one of the few administration certificates which are\u00a0well known\u00a0even for non-tech hiring managers.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That conclude pretty much&nbsp;everything&nbsp;that I had on my mind&nbsp;regarding&nbsp;RHCSA.
