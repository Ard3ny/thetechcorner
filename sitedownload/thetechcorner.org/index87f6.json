As always, there are several ways how to create or edit files. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One way of creating an empty text file is using a touch command <\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"is-layout-flow wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\"><strong>touch test.txt<\/strong><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Or just using a redirection mention before<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre id=\"block-31003806-ace1-4aa1-8bb2-473ab6e55349\" class=\"wp-block-preformatted\"><strong>&gt; <strong>test.txt<\/strong><\/strong><\/pre>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Another way could be using command echo<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"is-layout-flow wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\"><strong>echo 'This is a test' &gt; data.txt<\/strong><\/pre>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>And last but not least is using a text editor. The two most used text editors are <strong>The vi \/ vim<\/strong> or nano. There are many more, but these are good enough. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>VIM<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Type vi <em>filename<\/em> and press \u21b5 Enter. Alternatively, you can type vim <em>filename<\/em> to make sure the file opens in Vim instead of Vi. The &#8220;vi&#8221; part of this command selects the Vim text editor as the program to use. Replace <em>filename<\/em> with the name you wish to assign to your new file.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>For a file named &#8220;test.text&#8221;, for example, you&#8217;d type vi test.txt<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"is-layout-flow wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\"><strong>vi\/vim test.txt<\/strong><\/pre>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Press the i key. When you open Vi or Vim, it opens in a special mode called Command mode. Pressing the I key will place you into Insert mode, which is where you&#8217;ll do your typing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>You should see &#8212; INSERT &#8212; pop up at the bottom of the window when you press the <em>I<\/em> key.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Press the Esc key. This takes you back to Command mode. Command mode is where you&#8217;ll do things like save, copy, paste, and quit. You&#8217;ll know you&#8217;re in command mode when you no longer see &#8220;INSERT&#8221; at the bottom of the window.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>You can use the arrow keys to move around the document while you&#8217;re in Command mode in both Vi and Vim. Vim also lets you use the arrow keys to move in Insert mode.<\/li><li>Return to Insert mode at any time by pressing the i key.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Type :w and press \u21b5 Enter. All Vi\/Vim commands begin with a colon, and the :w command saves the file (think of &#8220;w&#8221; as &#8220;write&#8221;).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>If you created a file without a name (or want to save the current edits to a new file), type :w <em>filename<\/em> instead, replacing <em>filename<\/em> with the name you want to give this file.<\/li><li>To get help and learn more about Vi\/Vim commands, type :help in Command mode and press Enter.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Type :q and press \u21b5 Enter to exit. This closes your file and brings you back to the command prompt.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>To reopen the file, just type vi <em>filename<\/em> or vim <em>filename<\/em>.<\/li><li>You can also save and quit at the same time by typing :wq in Command mode.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Another very useful shortcuts:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>o                                                                                                                        \/\/new line\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>dd                                                                                                                    \/\/delete<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>yy                                                                                                                   \/\/yenk aka copy<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>p<\/strong>                                                                                                       <strong> \/\/paste<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>v                                                                                                                     \/\/visual mode where i can copy more lines<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>u                                                                                                                    \/\/undo<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>ctrl + r                                                                                                        \/\/redo<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>gg                                                                                                               \/\/cursor to the first line of document<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>G                                                                                                                 \/\/to the last line of the document<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>\/text                                                                                                           \/\/search for a word text downwards<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>?text                                                                                                          \/\/search for a word text upwords<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>^                                                                                                                \/\/bring cursor to begining of line<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>$                                                                                                                \/\/bring cursor to the end of the line<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>:%s\/old\/new\/g                                                                                   \/\/sed words old for words new<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>NANO<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Type nano <em>filename<\/em> and press \u21b5 Enter.

The commands you can use while typing into your file appear at the bottom of Nano. To see more commands, simply enlarge the window by dragging it from one of its corners.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The commands either start with a carat (^) or an M. The carat represents the Control key, while the M represents the Alt key.<ul><li>For example, ^U is the command to paste. To paste something you&#8217;ve copied, you&#8217;d press Control + U.<\/li><li>M-U is the command to undo the last action.

Since you&#8217;ve already given your file a name, you won&#8217;t be asked to give this file a name. However, if you started a file without giving it a name (by just running nano from the prompt with no file name), you&#8217;ll be asked to type the name for your new file and press Enter to save.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Press Control+X to exit Nano.
