                      <h3>Begging of your Homelab life</h3>



                      <p>As a first step on your homelab journey, you should set up an environment where you can easily deploy, manage and backup your virtual machines (VMs). Running your services in virtual machines rather than on bare metal hardware is much more efficient, cheaper and overall less difficult. </p>
                      
                      
                      
                      <h3>Hypervisor</h3>
                      
                      
                      
                      <p>Hypervisor is just a fancy-sounding word for the software/firmware/hardware that actually creates and manages virtual machines.</p>
                      
                      
                      
                      <p>There are two primary types: bare metal and hosted.</p>
                      
                      
                      
                      <p>Type 1 or bare metal hypervisors are installed directly onto the host system&#8217;s hardware. You can think of a bare metal hypervisor being like an operating system that is just dedicated to creating and managing virtual machines.</p>
                      
                      
                      
                      <p>Type 2 or hosted hypervisors are like those you&#8217;ve already mentioned. VirtualBox, VMWare Workstation, etc., are hypervisors installed on an existing operating system that lets you run virtual machines on that system. They are not directly managing the hardware of your system, but rely on the underlying OS for that.</p>
                      
                      
                      
                      <p>It also helps to think of these things in layers. In a type 1 architecture, the layering goes: hardware &gt; hypervisor &gt; guest operating system(s).</p>
                      
                      
                      
                      <p>In a type 2 architecture, the layering goes: hardware &gt; host operating system &gt; hypervisor &gt; guest operating system(s)</p>
                      
                      
                      
                      <p></p>
                      
                      
                      
                      <p><strong>My choice of a hypervisor is <a href="https://www.proxmox.com/en/">Proxmox</a>.</strong></p>
                      
                      
                      
                      <div class="is-layout-constrained wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
                      <pre class="wp-block-preformatted">Proxmox is complete open-source platform for enterprise virtualization. With the built-in web interface you can easily manage VMs and containers, software-defined storage and networking, high-availability clustering, and multiple out-of-the-box tools on a single solution.</pre>
                      </div></div>
                      
                      
                      
                      <p>It&#8217;s very light way compared to other hypervisor with very nice GUI and great community. It&#8217;s running od debian so you can use pretty much anything to host your proxmox.</p>
                      
                      
                      
                      <p>In my case, I&#8217;m going to use an old laptop (Asus X550vb) which has been sitting on my shelf eating dust for a few years now.</p>
