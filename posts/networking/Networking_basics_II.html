                      <span>Networking basics II – DNS, SSH, NFS, NAT</span>
                      <p>In the previous <a href="https://thetechcorner.org/?p=267">post</a> I&#8217;ve explained to you the very basics of the networking, what&#8217;s the OSI Model, TCP/IP model, Router, Switch, LAN and WAN. </p>



                      <p>In the second chapter of this series, I&#8217;m going to continue with another important protocols that are regularly used in administration or even non-tech person life.</p>
                      
                      
                      
                      <p></p>
                      
                      
                      
                      <h3><strong>DNS</strong></h3>
                      
                      
                      
                      <p> You could say that the Domain Name System or shortly DNS is the phone book of the internet.  </p>
                      
                      
                      
                      <p>So what is does is translation of the IP addresses to domain names. </p>
                      
                      
                      
                      <p>While the IP convention scheme allows computers to send each other messages, it&#8217;s not really handy for people to remember. For example, what would be easier for you to remember, the domain www.google.com or 8.8.8.8.? Maybe that was a bad example because the IP of Google is so easy, but you get the point.</p>
                      
                      
                      
                      <p><strong>How does it work?</strong></p>
                      
                      
                      
                      <p>The process of DNS resolution involves converting a hostname (www.test.com) into a computer friendly IP address, such as 192.168.1.1. An IP address is given to each device on the Internet, and that address is necessary to find the appropriate Internet device &#8211; like a street address is used to find a particular home. When a user wants to load a webpage, a translation must occur between what a user types into their web browser (example.com) and the machine-friendly address necessary to locate the example.com webpage.</p>
                      
                      
                      
                      <p></p>
                      
                      
                      
                      <h3><strong>SSH</strong></h3>
                      
                      
                      
                      <p>SSH or Secure Shell is a network communication protocol that enables two computers to communicate with each other and share data. This communication is encrypted, meaning it&#8217;s suitable for use on an insecure network.</p>
                      
                      
                      
                      <p>It&#8217;s most used case scenario is login and remote work on computers/servers, but it&#8217;s also possible to transfer data with it.</p>
                      
                      
                      
                      <p></p>
                      
                      
                      
                      <h3><strong>NFS</strong></h3>
                      
                      
                      
                      <p>Network File System or NFS is a protocol invented in the 80&#8217;s to facilitate better remote file sharing between computers. It enables the storage and retrieval of the data from multiple disks and directories across a shared network.</p>
                      
                      
                      
                      <p>An NFS uses a basic system where a “mount”  command will prompt the server to link with many clients. The clients will get access to the same files on the server through the proper platform. The design can use security protocols to dictate who will access certain files, producing a simplified and safe approach to work.</p>
                      
                      
                      
                      <p></p>
                      
                      
                      
                      <p><strong>How does it work?</strong></p>
                      
                      
                      
                      <p>An NFS can also use a file locking system that allows many clients to share the same files. The NFS can manage multiple application or compute threads for operation.<br>The NFS uses several hosts that will access the same files. It does not require one application for its operation, providing a simple design for handling the content one will read.</p>
                      
                      
                      
                      <h3><br><strong>NAT</strong></h3>
                      
                      
                      
                      <p>Network Address Translation or NAT is a process in which one or more local IP address is translated into one or more global IP addresses.</p>
                      
                      
                      
                      <p>The idea of NAT is to allow multiple devices to access the internet through a single public address.</p>
                      
                      
                      
                      <p></p>
                      
                      
                      
                      <p><strong>How does it work?</strong></p>
                      
                      
                      
                      <p>Generally, the border router is configured for NAT i.e the router which has one interface in the local (inside) network and one interface in the global (outside) network. When a packet traverse outside the local (inside) network, then NAT converts that local (private) IP address to a global (public) IP address. When a packet enters the local network, the global (public) IP address is converted to a local (private) IP address.&nbsp;</p>

                      <h3><strong>Firewall</strong></h3>
                      
                      
                      
                      <p>A firewall is a security device, it can be computer hardware or software. Firewall&nbsp;can help protect your network by filtering traffic and blocking outsiders from&nbsp;gaining unauthorized access to the private data on your computer.</p>
                      
                      
                      
                      <p>Not only does a firewall block unwanted traffic, it can also help block malicious software from infecting your computer.</p>
                      
                      
                      
                      <p>A firewall acts as a gatekeeper. It monitors attempts to gain access to&nbsp;your operating system and blocks unwanted traffic or unrecognized sources.</p>
                      
                      
                      
                      <p>How does it do this? A firewall acts as a barrier or filter between your&nbsp;computer and another network such as the internet.&nbsp;</p>
                      
                      
                      
                      <p></p>
                      
                      
                      
                      <p><strong>How does it work?</strong></p>
                      
                      
                      
                      <p>To start, a firewalled system analyzes network traffic based on rules. A&nbsp;firewall only welcomes those incoming connections that it has been configured&nbsp;to accept. It does this by allowing or blocking specific data packets — units&nbsp;of communication you send over digital networks — based on pre-established&nbsp;security rules.</p>
                      
                      
                      
                      <p>A firewall works like a traffic guard at your computer’s entry point, or&nbsp;port. Only trusted sources, or IP addresses, are allowed in. IP addresses are&nbsp;important because they&nbsp;identify a computer or source, just like your postal address identifies where you live.</p>
                      
                      
                      
                      <p></p>
