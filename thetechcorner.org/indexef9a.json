Those may be supported by embedded developers, but normally a Linux file system like the 4 extended file system (ext4), XFS, or BTRFS will be used for most storage partitions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>vfat<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is rather not precise to put them in one group together because <code>vfat<\/code>\u00a0is the most common driver for mounting FAT 16,32 and exFAT file systems.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>FAT16, FAT32, and exFAT are Microsoft\u2019s FAT file systems supported by Linux and used for formatting a drive. They have no journal, which makes them good for portable memory devices. They are default in every OS, whether it is Windows, macOS, or Linux. These file systems are great if you want to format an external drive using other OS. Nowadays, exFAT is the most appropriate version, as FAT32 is not so powerful. exFAT works with large files over 4 GB and partitions more than 8 GB, which is impossible for older (FAT32, FAT16) versions. NTFS is a newer and enhanced version of exFAT, with strengthened security and object\u2013oriented applications.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>ext4<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ext4 and Ext3 were created for compatibility reasons. The one has a built\u2013in Ext4 file system, as Ext3, Ext2, and backwards. It was enhanced and involves fresh updates that reduced file fragmentation, made it possible to have larger files and sizes, and has a delayed allocation, which is profitable for flash memory duration. It is a basic or default version of the file system on Linux, nowadays. It had lots of updates and work put in it, so it is widely popular.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>xfs<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>XFS was created for Linux in 2001 by Silicon Graphics. It was made for the SGI IRX OS. It doesn\u2019t support mounted snapshots and has delayed allocation for enhancing file fragmentation, and with such features, it is similar to Ext4. XFS recommended being effective with large files, but it doesn\u2019t work well with small files, and the performance is worse than in many other file systems. So those who are trying to find something for their service that works with large files can consider XFS as an option.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>TLDR: In my eyes ext4 or NTFS always win, but there are now even more and better file system, which RHCSA doesn&#8217;t include, but I&#8217;m just going to throw bit of nerd dirt to ya.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>zfs<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>ZFS uses a hierarchical system layout defined by location- and- conductor-specific sub-module ports each of which is restricted in the locality. Basically, it manages the physical storage of data through storage pools, which allow file systems to share disk space within the pool.\u00a0When users need a larger storage pool, they add disks\u00a0similar to\u00a0adding memory to a computer. As users add storage space, the file systems automatically use the additional memory without the user needing to configure that memory or assign individual processes. This system limits human touch, making it not only easy to use but also highly reliable.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>ZFS also offers a built-in snapshot, which can grab a picture of stored data at a precise instant. Users find snapshots quick and easy. Snapshots take up no extra disk space in the pool at first, but as data evolves, they reference old data and thus consume some space<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"zfs-and-ext4-for-nas-advantages-and-disadvantages\">ZFS and EXT4 for NAS \u2013 Advantages and Disadvantages<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While ext4 comes embedded on Linux, it may not be the right choice for managing your data.\u00a0Consider the strengths of each system in light of your needs.\u00a0 On the face of it, ZFS seems better but arrives with much higher hardware requirements to run smoothly. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whereas EXT4 has much lower hardware running requirements but has it\u2019s own limitations elsewhere. Let\u2019s shine the spotlight on them both.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"using-vfat-formating\">Using <strong>vfat <\/strong>formating<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For vfat we use mkfs command
