But this number can be pushed even further with some easy overclocking adjustments. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This can help a lot with your future projects which might require a lot computing power.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I <strong>HIGHLY<\/strong> recommend using some sort of cooling case or fan because Raspberry PI 4 B has gotten so powerfull that now you pretty much need to have a fan to be able to use it to full potential.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>WARNING! <\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You might see some crashes if you don&#8217;t have a fan or you want to push your PI even harder. This might corrupt your SD card, so if you have any data that you don&#8217;t want to lose you should backup your PI or use clean Raspbian installation. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Useful information<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Although Raspberry PI 4 B can run at 1.5GHz, it typically idles at 600MHz and only boost clock higher when needed. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>if you don&#8217;t know what overclocking is, basically it&#8217;s just process in which we set higher allowed maximum clock speed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every unit is <strong>different!<\/strong> My settings might end up crashing your PI and vice versa. Also it should be noted that I&#8217;m using both fan and aluminium case which can absorb a lot of heat. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Let&#8217;s get started<\/strong> <\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>If you didn&#8217;t setup your PI yet, here is a tutorial for that.<\/li><li>After that, make sure you are running the latest update and the latest version of the Raspbian OS.
