To do so:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Open the SSH terminal<\/strong> on your machine and run the following command: <strong>ssh username@host_ip_address<\/strong><br>If the username on your local machine matches the one on the server you are trying to connect to, you can just type: ssh host_ip_address And hit Enter.<\/li><li><strong>Type in your password and hit Enter<\/strong>. Note that you will not get any feedback on the screen while typing. If you are pasting your password, make sure it is stored safely and not in a text file.<\/li><li>When you are connecting to a server for the very first time, it will ask you if you want to continue connecting. J<strong>ust type yes and hit Enter<\/strong>. This message appears only this time, since the remote server is not identified on your local machine.<\/li><li><strong>An ECDSA key fingerprint is now added, and you are co<\/strong>nnected to the remote server.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>You can see your ecdsa key by typing the following command<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"is-layout-flow wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>ssh-keygen -l -f \/etc\/ssh\/ssh_host_ecdsa_key.pub<\/code><\/pre>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>What even is this ecdsa key?
