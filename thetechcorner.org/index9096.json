Well, at least for the main study part, I&#8217;m still planning on creating some practice exams exercises and some useful links to help you (and me) with the exam.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the first and main step, you should memorize the most of the commands and what they do. You don&#8217;t have to learn specific flags for the most of them (even tho it will come handy) because you can just use the man pages. But the man pages won&#8217;t help you a thing if you don&#8217;t even know the name of the command or the necessary steps for completing the task. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To not have to go through the commands over and over in my posts, I&#8217;ve created simple cheat sheet notes that you can just &#8220;ctrl+f&#8221; your way through. It&#8217;s on my GitHub which I&#8217;ll be adding more tips and commands as I go through it, enjoy!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/Ard3ny\/RHCSA8_CheatSheet\/blob\/main\/RHCSA8-Cheat-Sheet.txt\">https:\/\/github.com\/Ard3ny\/RHCSA8_CheatSheet\/blob\/main\/RHCSA8-Cheat-Sheet.txt<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Our RHCSA 8 series has finally come to an end.
