										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>To start learning about networking and how it all works, first you need to understand <strong>the</strong> <strong>basics</strong>. One of the most important ones is the <strong>concept</strong> <strong>of </strong>that <strong>how communication</strong> between devices on the network <strong>works</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>OSI Model</strong> can give you the best idea for that. There is a new model that is used nowadays called <strong>TCP/IP</strong> but I think this is better to start with. </p>



<p></p>



<h2><strong>OSI Model</strong></h2>



<p>Simply put <strong>OSI model</strong> is a sequence of steps for communication between devices which are described in <strong>7 layer model</strong> called the OSI model. It was made so there would be strict protocol, which <strong>all devices must follow</strong>, so there wouldn&#8217;t be any confusion and for people to understand how it all works.</p>



<p>It looks something like this and it works both ways. That means it <strong>starts</strong> with a <strong>Senders application layer </strong>going threw all of the layers, <strong>ends </strong>with <strong>Physical layer </strong>and then is <strong>sent</strong> <strong>over the network</strong> to the <strong>physical layer</strong> of the <strong>Reciever</strong> and <strong>again</strong> <strong>going threw all the layers</strong> and ends with the <strong>Application layer</strong>.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="369" src="https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/pngegg-1-3.png?resize=640%2C369&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-277" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/pngegg-1-3.png?w=735&amp;ssl=1 735w, https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/pngegg-1-3.png?resize=300%2C173&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p></p>



<p><strong>Let&#8217;s start from the top</strong> I think that&#8217;s the easiest way to explain it.</p>



<h4><strong>Layer 7: Application Layer</strong></h4>



<p>Communication starts <strong>on</strong> the <strong>top</strong> with the <strong>Appliccation layer which is closest to the end user</strong>. <strong>This layer interacts with the software applications</strong>. There applications are outside of the OSI model. Application layer functions typically include identifying communication partners, determining resource availability and synchronizing communication.</p>



<p></p>



<h4><strong>Layer 6: Presentation Layer</strong></h4>



<p><strong>The presentation layer establishes&nbsp;a bridge&nbsp;between application layer entities</strong> (which can all have different syntax and langue) <strong>and the</strong> <strong>network format </strong>(which need to stay the same).</p>



<p></p>



<h4><strong>Layer 5: Session Layer</strong></h4>



<p>The session layer main function is to establish, manage and terminate the connections between the local and remote application. Simply put, it controls the dialogues (connections) between computers. </p>



<p>The session layer ensures that the session stays open long enough to transfer all the data being exchanged, and then promptly closes the session in order to avoid wasting resources.</p>



<h4><strong>Layer 4: Transport Layer</strong></h4>



<p><strong>The transport Layer is responsible for end-to-end communication between the two devices</strong>. It takes data from the session layer and breaks them up into chunks called segments before sending it to layer 3. </p>



<p>Layer 4 is also responsible for the flow control (optimal speed so it won&#8217;t be too slow or too fast)and error control (when it receives the data, it makes sure that they are complete and request a retransmission they aren&#8217;t).</p>



<p></p>



<h4><strong>Layer 3: Network Layer</strong></h4>



<p><strong>The network layer is responsible for managing data transfer between two different networks.</strong> If the two devices are on the same network, then this layer is unnecessary.</p>



<p>The network layer breaks up segments from&nbsp;the transport layer&nbsp;into even smaller units called packets.&nbsp;Then these packets&nbsp;are sent&nbsp;to the&nbsp;receiver&nbsp;and&nbsp;reassembled&nbsp;there. </p>



<p>This layer is also responsible for finding the best physical path for the data to reach its destination.</p>



<p></p>



<h4><strong>Layer 2: The Data link Layer</strong></h4>



<p>The data link layer is very similar to the network layer except <strong>it is used when data is transferred between devices on the same network.</strong></p>



<p>The data link layer takes packets from the network layer and breaks them into even smaller pieces called frames.</p>



<p>As network layer it&#8217;s also responsible for the flow control and error control.</p>



<p></p>



<h4><strong>Layer 1: The Physical Layer</strong></h4>



<p><strong>The physical layer is responsible for the transmission and reception of unstructured raw data between devices.</strong> It converts the digital bits (frames) into analog electrical, radio (wifi) or optical signal.</p>



<p>Layer specifications define characteristics such as voltage levels, the timing of voltage changes, physical data rates, maximum transmission distances, channel access method and physical connectors, etc.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<h2><strong>TCP/IP Model</strong></h2>



<p>The&nbsp;<strong>OSI Model</strong>&nbsp;I just explained to you is just a <strong>reference/logical model</strong>. It was designed to describe the functions of the communication system by dividing the communication procedure into smaller and simpler components. But TCP/IP model was designed and developed by the Department of Defense (DoD) in 1960s and is based on standard protocols. It stands for T<strong>ransmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol</strong>. The&nbsp;<strong>TCP/IP model</strong>&nbsp;is a concise version of the OSI model. It contains four layers, unlike seven layers in the OSI model. The layers are:</p>



<ol><li><strong>Process/Application Layer</strong></li><li><strong>Host-to-Host/Transport Layer</strong></li><li><strong>Internet Layer</strong></li><li><strong>Network Access/Link Layer</strong></li></ol>



<p>Here is a comparison of the two modes from <a href="https://www.educba.com/">www.educba.com</a></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="640" height="367" src="https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/OSI-Model-vs-TCPIP-Model.png?resize=640%2C367&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-285" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/OSI-Model-vs-TCPIP-Model.png?w=775&amp;ssl=1 775w, https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/OSI-Model-vs-TCPIP-Model.png?resize=300%2C172&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/OSI-Model-vs-TCPIP-Model.png?resize=768%2C441&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<p></p>



<p><strong>It is the condensed version of the OSI Model.</strong></p>



<h4><strong>Network Access Layer</strong></h4>



<p><strong>Network Access Layer is the combination of Data Link Layer and Physical Layer</strong> available in the OSI model. Physical Addressing is done in this layer, i.e. &nbsp;MAC Address of source and destination is assigned to the data packets. Hence this layer is responsible for the physical transmission of data.</p>



<h4><strong>Internet Layer</strong></h4>



<p><strong>The Internet layer is used to send an independent packet to a network to the destination</strong>. All the machines, Web servers, nodes that are attached to the TCP/IP network are assigned in this layer.</p>



<h4><strong>Transport layer</strong></h4>



<p><strong>It allows the information to be delivered in an informative chart format from the source to the destination host without defects.</strong></p>



<h4><strong>Application Layer</strong></h4>



<p><strong>Application layer performs the tasks of the OSI model in three layers: Application, Presentation and Session Layer. </strong>It is required for the interaction between node and node and handles the requirements of the user interface. Protocols available in the Application Layer are TFTP, HTTP, Telnet, SSH, NTP, DNS, NFS, FTP, SNMP, DHCP, SMTP (which I will talk about later in other posts).</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>Now you should have the slightest idea of how the data is sent from device to device. But let&#8217;s talk about the devices now.</strong></p>



<p><strong>I&#8217;m gonna talk about networking devices only as I don&#8217;t think I need to explain what&#8217;s the PC, printer, etc.</strong></p>



<p></p>



<h2><strong>Network hub</strong></h2>



<p><strong>A network hub</strong>, also called <strong>ethernet hub</strong>, <strong>repeater</strong> or just <strong>hub</strong> is a networking device for <strong>connecting multiple ethernet devices together</strong> and making them act as a single network. If you know USB hubs this is same thing, but for ethernet devices.</p>



<p>It has multiple ports that works both ways, they receive but they also send data. This feature is called I/O &#8211; Input/output. </p>



<p>The way it works it&#8217;s very simple. Singnal introduced at the input of any ports appears at the output of every port except one that send the singnal. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s called repeater, it only repeats the signal. </p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>Hubs work at the Layer 1 (physical layer) of the OSI model</strong>.  So it&#8217;s working with the raw analog signal. From all the devices I&#8217;m gonna tell you about this one is the most simple one. You can try reading again about the OSI model if you got lost.</p>



<p>One the left you can see how it may look like and on the right side there is a CISCO (one of the biggest network organizations) symbol for a hub.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="640" height="237" src="https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/pngegg-1-2.png?resize=640%2C237&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-271" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/pngegg-1-2.png?w=746&amp;ssl=1 746w, https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/pngegg-1-2.png?resize=300%2C111&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<p></p>



<h2><strong>Switch</strong></h2>



<p><strong>A switch</strong> is a networking device that <strong>also connects multiple devices together to the one network</strong>. That includes computers, printers and servers. Because of the switch they can all communicate together regardless of their position.</p>



<p>You may be asking yourself now, hmm but what&#8217;s the difference, isn&#8217;t this just the hub? <strong>The difference between a hub and a switch is that switch only forwards data to the device that it should receive but hub sends data to all of the devices.</strong></p>



<p>For that switch uses MAC addresses to forward data to the correct destination.</p>



<p><strong>It&#8217;s a Layer 2 device operating on the data link layer of the OSi model. </strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="640" height="244" src="https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-46.png?resize=640%2C244&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-272" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-46.png?w=1108&amp;ssl=1 1108w, https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-46.png?resize=300%2C115&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-46.png?resize=1024%2C391&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-46.png?resize=768%2C293&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<p></p>



<h2><strong>Router </strong></h2>



<p><strong>A router</strong> is a networking device that serve two primary functions:</p>



<ul><li><strong>creating and maintaing a local area network</strong></li><li><strong>managing the data (inside the network and entering the networking as well)</strong></li></ul>



<p></p>



<p><strong>Simply put they connect computer networks together</strong>. For example, one is connecting your home network to the internet just now. But don&#8217;t get confused the one that you have in your home is a multifunction device that serve as a Router, Wifi Access Point, Switch and even more. </p>



<p><strong>Routers operate at Layer 3 (network layer) of the OSI model.</strong></p>



<p>Ultimately, a router works as a dispatcher, directing traffic and choosing the most efficient route for information, in the form of data packets, to travel across a network. A router connects your device to the world, protects information from security threats, and even decides which devices have priority over others.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Your router at home looks probably something like this. </p>

<p></p>



<p></p>



<h2><strong>LAN</strong></h2>



<p><strong>A local area network (LAN)</strong> is a computer network that <strong>interconnects computers within a limited area</strong> (your home, school, office building).</p>



<p><strong>According to CISCO</strong> a LAN comprises cables, access points, switches, routers, and other components that enable devices to connect to internal servers, web servers, and other LANs via wide area networks (WAN).</p>



<p>The rise of virtualization has also fueled the development of virtual LANs, which enable network administrators to logically group network nodes and partition their networks without a need for major infrastructure changes.</p>



<p>For example, in an office with multiple departments, such as accounting, IT support, and administration, each department&#8217;s computer could be logically connected to the same switch but segmented to behave as if they are separate.</p>



<p></p>



<h2><strong>WAN</strong></h2>



<p><strong>A wide area network (WAN) is a network that extends over a large geographic area. </strong></p>



<p>It&#8217;s a collection of LANs, or other networks that communicate together. </p>



<p>Simply but It ties all of LANs together.</p>



<p></p>

<p></p>



<p>I think <strong>these are must know basics for absolute beginners</strong>. There is so much <strong>more</strong> to explain, but I don&#8217;t want to overcomplicate this if this is all new for you. </p>



<p>In my next article I&#8217;ll explain what is IP and MAC address, the fundamental protocol for communication TCP/IP, how IP address gets its own domain and more. So if you are interested, check out my blog next time as well.</p>
