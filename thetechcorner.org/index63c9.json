There are probabaly at minimum around 20 OS&#8217;s you can run on Raspberry PI.  You can even run the Windows ARM version on your PI. But then your full small programmable computer that can do pretty much anything kinda loses it&#8217;s purpose, right? Therefore, for this example we will run Raspbian, because it&#8217;s the easiest one to run and is probably the most compatible one as it was made exactly for this reason. But you can check out all the other possible OS&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.raspberrypi.org\/software\/operating-systems\/\">here<\/a>. <\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>You can download three versions of Rasbian. Lite version, OS with desktop GUI version and OS with desktop GUI and all the other recommended software version. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"389\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/thetechcorner.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/image-1.png?resize=640%2C389&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-141\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/thetechcorner.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/image-1.png?w=1608&amp;ssl=1 1608w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/thetechcorner.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/image-1.png?resize=300%2C182&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/thetechcorner.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/image-1.png?resize=1024%2C622&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/thetechcorner.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/image-1.png?resize=768%2C467&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/thetechcorner.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/image-1.png?resize=1536%2C933&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/thetechcorner.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/image-1.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We will continue with the <strong>Raspberry PI OS with desktop and recommended software<\/strong> because is the one that requries the least knowledge if you are not familiar with using a terminal or Linux. You can download the newest version <a href=\"https:\/\/www.raspberrypi.org\/software\/operating-systems\/\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. Our next step will be downloading the software that will help us with writing the image. My favourite one is <a href=\"https:\/\/rufus.ie\/\">Rufus<\/a> so I&#8217;ll be using that. You will need to insert your SD card or USB into your PC and open up Rufus. Then, you will select the <strong>Device<\/strong> on which you want to write the image and <strong>SELECT<\/strong> the image that you want to write and then you press <strong>START<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"466\" height=\"533\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/thetechcorner.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/image-2.png?resize=466%2C533&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-142\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/thetechcorner.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/image-2.png?w=466&amp;ssl=1 466w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/thetechcorner.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/image-2.png?resize=262%2C300&amp;ssl=1 262w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 466px) 100vw, 466px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Installation process with a monitor<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>After the proccess of writing the image is complete you will need to <strong>insert<\/strong> the <strong>SD card\/USB into your Raspberry PI <\/strong>and <strong>connect<\/strong> your <strong>HDMI<\/strong> and <strong>power supply<\/strong> as well as your peripherals (<strong>keyboard and mouse<\/strong>). After a few seconds you should be greeted with a booting screen and a configuration process of your new OS in which you will select your country, timezone, language and the password of your wifi network. Now, If you connect your PI to WIFI, the system will ask you if you wish to automaticaly update your software packages to the newest version (If you don&#8217;t want to connect to WIFI now, or you want to use the ethernet cable, I will show you how to do so later on in this guide).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Installation process without a monitor<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are like me and you had no idea that <strong>Raspberry PI 4 B<\/strong> comes with a <strong>mini HDMI port<\/strong> and not a normal sized version, this guide is for you! <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The proccess is similar to an installation with a monitor, but first we need to add one more file into the booting section so Raspberry PI will know we want to connect to it over <strong>SSH<\/strong>. Now we need to create an empty file named &#8220;SSH&#8221;. The tricky part is that windows isn&#8217;t exactly the best thing for doing this easily. First, we need to <strong>right click&gt;new text document<\/strong> and call it <strong>SSH<\/strong>. However, we just made a text file and we need an empty file right? To do this, we need to <strong>open<\/strong> our <strong>SSH.txt<\/strong> file and in the left upper corner click <strong>File&gt;Save as<\/strong> and we will rename it to <strong>&#8220;SSH&#8221;<\/strong> with the quotation marks and select our Save as type as All Files. Then just press save and we should have an empty file called SSH.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"465\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/thetechcorner.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/image-4.png?resize=640%2C465&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-146\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/thetechcorner.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/image-4.png?w=1043&amp;ssl=1 1043w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/thetechcorner.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/image-4.png?resize=300%2C218&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/thetechcorner.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/image-4.png?resize=1024%2C743&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/thetechcorner.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/image-4.png?resize=768%2C557&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After this you can insert the SD card\/USB into a PI, connect all your peripherals (keyboard and mouse) and a network cable.
