										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>What is <strong>a Pi-Hole</strong> you may ask yourself.  Is it some sort of cooling solution in which you drill a hole into your Raspberry Pi? Or maybe it is some cooking recipe?! </p>



<p>The answer is no, it&#8217;s something way better in today&#8217;s digital age.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi-hole">Wikipedia </a>Pi-Hole is a Linux network-level advertisement and internet tracker blocking application which acts as a DNS sinkhole and optionally a DHCP server, intended for use on a private network.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Beautifully said, but maybe I will try to explain it a little bit more &#8220;user friendly&#8221;. I&#8217;ll start with an example.</p>



<p>Do you know that feeling when you are scrolling on your phone and you see an interesting article, so you click on it and there are either 15 ads waiting for you or one so huge that you cannot see even title of an article? </p>



<p>Yea, I hate that too. But there is a simple solution to this! </p>



<p><strong>A</strong> <strong>Pi-Hole</strong> is a peace of code that runs on a Linux (primarily Raspbian) and with very few installation commands it allows you to clear your sides and videos from all the unwanted ads which can even take up a lot of internet bandwidth.</p>



<p>Now you are like <strong>&#8220;I just turn on my ad-block, I don&#8217;t need no Pi-Hole for that&#8221;</strong> but no, <strong>this is much better</strong> and here is why.</p>



<p><strong>A</strong> <strong>Pi-Hole</strong> works at the network level layer which means It&#8217;s not filtering them out after your browser downloaded them, you actually wont even download them, which can save up a lot of bandwidth. </p>



<p>Another great advantage of the Pi-Hole is that It cooperates with the router so <strong>ALL of the devices on your network will be ads free</strong>! You cannot install ad-block and all of your mobile apps that are using ads nor you cannot install ad-block on your TV. But with this you only need one device connected to your router and you are done. </p>



<p>Just imagine how many ads you see daily, then multiply it by number of devices in your network. How much bandwidth will you save? A lot right?</p>



<h2><strong>How does it work?</strong></h2>



<p>Ok, so If you don&#8217;t know what a <strong>DNS</strong> is, basically it&#8217;s a <strong>naming system</strong> in which <strong>IP address</strong> <strong>gets their own domain</strong> (for example 192.0.2.44 = www.amazon.com). This feature is usally provided by billion dollars companies like google, amazon&#8230;</p>



<p>Your router is configured in the way that when you visit a site, that site makes a lot of requests for a lot of the stuff. And guess what? It uses a DNS for that (well, mostly, I&#8217;ll talk about that later)</p>



<p>Here is where the Pi-Hole comes. In your network, the <strong>Pi will act as a DNS server</strong>. But you can now insert a list for all of the DNS domains you don&#8217;t want to see, <strong>a blocklist</strong>. This allows the Pi to filter out any ad requests from sites, apps, etc. This list is over 100 000 lines long and it&#8217;s always updating by a people that hate ads as we do!</p>



<p></p>



<h2><strong>How to set it up?</strong></h2>



<h3>1. <strong>First, you will need a few things:</strong></h3>



<ol><li>Raspberry Pi (any model will do for this)</li><li>SD card / USB</li><li>Power supply </li><li>Ethernet Cable (you could also you a wifi, but ethernet is just way better in performance and reliability)</li></ol>



<p></p>



<h3><strong>2. Seting up your your PI. </strong></h3>



<p>You can find guide for that <a href="https://thetechcorner.org/?p=136">here</a>!</p>



<p></p>



<h3><strong>3.  Download and install the Pi-Hole</strong></h3>



<div class="is-layout-flow wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">wget -O basic-install.sh https://install.pi-hole.net
sudo bash basic-install.sh</pre>
</div></div>



<p>You should see a welcome window looking like this.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="356" src="https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-28.png?resize=640%2C356&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-229" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-28.png?w=1278&amp;ssl=1 1278w, https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-28.png?resize=300%2C167&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-28.png?resize=1024%2C570&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-28.png?resize=768%2C427&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<p></p>



<p><strong>Just press</strong> <strong>OK</strong> to begin the installation. Pi-hole will ask you for a donation, but it&#8217;s totally up to you if you want to donate or not, the program will still be fully functional. I think Pi-Hole is great and maybe if you will like it too you can consider donating something small.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="640" height="66" src="https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-29.png?resize=640%2C66&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-230" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-29.png?w=1259&amp;ssl=1 1259w, https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-29.png?resize=300%2C31&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-29.png?resize=1024%2C106&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-29.png?resize=768%2C79&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<p></p>



<p>In the next step Pi-Hole will explain to you why you need a <strong>static IP address</strong> and in the next section will ask you to make your current IP address static. If you don&#8217;t want to use any particular IP address, than you should choose this one (there is actually one more step before this, but they added it here for some reason).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="640" height="60" src="https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-30.png?resize=640%2C60&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-231" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-30.png?w=1257&amp;ssl=1 1257w, https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-30.png?resize=300%2C28&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-30.png?resize=1024%2C95&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-30.png?resize=768%2C71&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<p></p>



<p><strong>Pi-Hole will ask</strong> you for the <strong>upstream DNS provider</strong> to which it will connect. You can use this tool as a benchmark for the fastest one for you, but It really won&#8217;t make a big difference, so you can just choose <strong>Google</strong> or <strong>CloudFlare</strong> if you don&#8217;t like google tracking you (not that any other companies won&#8217;t do it).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="640" height="87" src="https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-31.png?resize=640%2C87&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-232" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-31.png?w=1257&amp;ssl=1 1257w, https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-31.png?resize=300%2C41&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-31.png?resize=1024%2C138&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-31.png?resize=768%2C104&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Pi-Hole is just a <strong>computer,</strong> so it doesn&#8217;t know on its own what domains should it block. We have people for that, who make lists of domains for that (blocklists). In this next step Pi-Hole will ask you <strong>what blocklists you want to use</strong>. For maximum efficiency, you should <strong>let it on the default</strong> (that means having all of them checked). Don&#8217;t get scared if you have more or less than I do. People make and merge new together all the time. <strong>You can download more</strong> of these <strong>blocklists</strong>, but more on that later.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="640" height="100" src="https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-32.png?resize=640%2C100&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-233" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-32.png?w=1252&amp;ssl=1 1252w, https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-32.png?resize=300%2C47&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-32.png?resize=1024%2C159&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-32.png?resize=768%2C120&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<p></p>



<p>In the next step Pi-Hole will ask you <strong>what protocols you want to use</strong>. If you don&#8217;t know anything about Ipv4/Ipv6 just leave it <strong>default</strong>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="640" height="49" src="https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-33.png?resize=640%2C49&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-234" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-33.png?w=1258&amp;ssl=1 1258w, https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-33.png?resize=300%2C23&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-33.png?resize=1024%2C78&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-33.png?resize=768%2C59&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<p></p>



<p>And now Pi-Hole will finally ask you if you want to use this IP address as your static IP address, which means It won&#8217;t change after reboot. If you don&#8217;t know anything about DHCP and static/dynamic IPs <strong>just press yes</strong>.</p>



<p></p>



<p>In the last step Pi-Hole will warn you that even if you set up your static IP on your PI your router can still assign it to another device. But with modern routers this shouldn&#8217;t really happen. <strong>Press OK</strong>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="640" height="49" src="https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-34.png?resize=640%2C49&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-235" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-34.png?w=1251&amp;ssl=1 1251w, https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-34.png?resize=300%2C23&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-34.png?resize=1024%2C78&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-34.png?resize=768%2C58&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Then you will have an option to install the web admin interface. <strong>I really like the web interface</strong> and I think you will like it too!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="640" height="78" src="https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-35.png?resize=640%2C78&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-236" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-35.png?w=1257&amp;ssl=1 1257w, https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-35.png?resize=300%2C37&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-35.png?resize=1024%2C125&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-35.png?resize=768%2C94&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<p></p>



<p>This feature requires a web server to work. They are only giving you the option because maybe you have your own web server and you don&#8217;t want another one. So just <strong>leave it</strong> <strong>on</strong> and <strong>continue</strong>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-36.png?resize=640%2C100&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-237" width="640" height="100" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-36.png?w=1241&amp;ssl=1 1241w, https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-36.png?resize=300%2C47&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-36.png?resize=1024%2C160&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-36.png?resize=768%2C120&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<p></p>



<p>In the next step you will have an option to make your Pi-Hole <strong>logs the queries</strong>. This is an important statistic which can help you troubleshoot problems or see how many ads, are you blocking daily/weekly etc. <strong>Keep it On and press OK.</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="640" height="75" src="https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-38.png?resize=640%2C75&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-241" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-38.png?w=1256&amp;ssl=1 1256w, https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-38.png?resize=300%2C35&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-38.png?resize=1024%2C121&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-38.png?resize=768%2C90&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Now you will be able to choose between all of the <strong>privacy modes</strong>. You can find what mode blocks what <a href="https://docs.pi-hole.net/ftldns/privacylevels/">here</a>, but if you don&#8217;t want to bother, <strong>just pick the first one</strong>. In this mode, you will be able to see all the statistics in your Pi-Hole web interface.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="640" height="81" src="https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-37.png?resize=640%2C81&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-240" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-37.png?w=1261&amp;ssl=1 1261w, https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-37.png?resize=300%2C38&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-37.png?resize=1024%2C129&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-37.png?resize=768%2C97&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<p></p>



<p>After this, wait a few minutes for Pi-Hole to finish an installation. You should see a window saying <strong>Installation Complete!</strong> But don&#8217;t close this yet! You need the IP address and most importantly your password! <strong>Now write them down</strong> somewhere, so you won&#8217;t forget. This password was randomly generated and <strong>if you lose this, you won&#8217;t be able to log into</strong> your admin account. We will change the password later, so just keep it for now.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="640" height="118" src="https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-39.png?resize=640%2C118&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-242" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-39.png?w=1284&amp;ssl=1 1284w, https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-39.png?resize=300%2C55&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-39.png?resize=1024%2C189&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/thetechcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-39.png?resize=768%2C142&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<p></p>



<h3><strong>4. Connecting Pi-Hole to your router</strong></h3>



<p>Now that Pi-Hole is running on our PI we can go to the routers settings and choose it as our DNS Server. </p>



<p><strong>To access your router type 192.168.0.1 or 192.168.1.1 into your browser</strong>. If the menu of your router still didn&#8217;t pop off, try googling your model and looking on forums (there will most likely be people like you who don&#8217;t know how to connect to their routers).</p>



<p>Now you should see a page asking for the <strong>login</strong> and the <strong>password</strong>. If you don&#8217;t know these, you can try to google and ask for default logging information. The password is sometimes written on the bottom of the router and login should be admin. If any of these works you will need to <strong>contact your provider</strong> and for this information. </p>



<p>If you have successfully connected into your router you will need to look for DNS Server or Primary and Secondary DNS settings. I have tp-link and I can find it under <strong>Advanced&gt;Network&gt;Internet&gt;Advanced&gt;DNS Address</strong> and choose <strong>Use the following DNS Addresses</strong>.</p>

<p></p>



<p>After that, you will see two empty columns called <strong>Primary DNS</strong> and <strong>Secondary DNS</strong>. If you remembered we gave our PI-Hole static IP address which we could see in the last step of the installation with the password. Mine is 192.168.137.118, but <strong>yours will be DIFFERENT</strong>. If you don&#8217;t know what is the address of your PI-Hole just <strong>open up a terminal</strong> in Raspbian and type:</p>



<div class="is-layout-flow wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">ip a</pre>
</div></div>



<p>Now <strong>type</strong> that I<strong>P</strong> <strong>into</strong> the <strong>Primary DNS</strong> column and <strong>press save</strong>.</p>

<p></p>



<p>You <strong>don&#8217;t need to fill out the Secondary DNS</strong> address because we only have one. </p>



<p></p>



<h3><strong>4B Connecting a Pi-Hole to your device</strong></h3>



<p>There is <strong>one more way</strong> to connect your Pi-Hole into your device, but <strong>only that one device would be able to use a Pi-Hole</strong>. This kinda loses its purpose and you will probably be better off with ad-block. But if for some reason you don&#8217;t want or can&#8217;t connect a Pi-Hole to your router, but still want to use this feature, <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/how-change-your-pcs-dns-settings-windows-10">here</a> is a tutorial how to change a DNS in your PC.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<h3><strong>5. Accessing the web interface of the Pi-Hole</strong></h3>



<p>To see a statistic of how many domains are your Pi-Hole blocking, you can <strong>access a web interface</strong> that you have agreed to install earlier. You can also make some <strong>extra configuration</strong> and <strong>customization</strong>, but your <strong>Pi-Hole set up</strong> is pretty much <strong>done</strong> so there isn&#8217;t much to do if anything. </p>



<p><strong>You can access the web interface anywhere from your local network</strong>. </p>



<p><strong>You can find it by typing http://IPofYourPi-Hole/admin. For me its http://192.168.137.118/admin/</strong></p>



<p>You should see something like this </p>

<p></p>



<p>On the left side, click <strong>Login</strong> and <strong>type in your password</strong> which was randomly generated in the installation and I told you to write it down!</p>



<p> </p>



<h3><strong>6. Adding more blocklists</strong></h3>



<p>One useful thing you can do is to <strong>add more of the blocklists</strong>. You can find the biggest collection of them <strong><a href="https://firebog.net/">here</a></strong>. They are made and updated by a guy with a nickname <strong><a href="https://firebog.net/about">Wally3K</a></strong> so big shout out to him!</p>



<p>You can choose whatever lists you like <strong>BUT BE AWARE THAT WITH THE MORE BLOCKLISTS YOU ADD THERE IS A BIGGER POSSIBILITY OF INTERFIERING WITH YOUR BROWSING EXPERIENCE</strong>. So, preferably only use the green ones because those shoudln&#8217;t interfere with the browsing.</p>



<p>The UI of the Pi-Hole is ever-changing, but for me it looks like this now. Go into a <strong>Group Management>Adlist</strong> and in the top you should see <strong>Add a new adlist</strong> and type the URL of the list you chose into the <strong>Address</strong>: column and press <strong>Add</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Congratulations</strong>, you have added a new blocklists into your Pi-Hole.</p>



<p></p>



<p>There is so much more you can do with a Pi-Hole but I wanted to make this installation <strong>easy</strong> and <strong>user friendly</strong> so I&#8217;ll end it here. I hope you enjoyed this tutorial and for now just enjoy your piece of a Pi.</p>
